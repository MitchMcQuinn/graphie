# Variable Handling Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Session Variable Inconsistency**: The Flask session and the workflow engine's session data were not properly synchronized, causing variables to be unavailable when needed.

2. **Unresolved Variable References**: Variables like `@{analyze-input}.is_positive` and `@{analyze-input}.feedback` were not being resolved correctly in the workflow.

3. **User Input Processing**: The workflow was getting stuck at the `get-input` step and not properly transitioning to the next steps after receiving user input.

4. **Workflow Node Configuration**: Some nodes were using incorrect function references, causing variable handling issues.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Enhanced `analyze.py` Module**:
   - Added proper variable storage for `is_positive` and `feedback` in the `sentiment_analysis` function
   - Ensured all necessary variables are stored in the session for later reference

2. **Fixed Workflow Node Configuration**:
   - Updated `provide-analysis` and `show-analysis` nodes to use `fixed_reply` instead of `format_analysis`
   - Corrected variable references in node configurations to use the variables that are actually available

3. **Improved `continue_workflow` Method**:
   - Enhanced the method to handle user input regardless of the `awaiting_input` flag
   - Added explicit handling for the `get-input` step to ensure proper transition to the next steps
   - Improved error handling and logging for better diagnostics

4. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Created diagnostic scripts to test variable handling in isolation
   - Implemented API testing scripts to verify end-to-end functionality
   - Added detailed logging to track variable resolution

## Results

The workflow now correctly:
1. Extracts animal names from user input and stores them in the session
2. Analyzes sentiment and stores the results in the session
3. Resolves variable references in reply templates
4. Transitions properly between workflow steps

Example successful response:
```json
{
  "awaiting_input": false,
  "has_pending_steps": true,
  "reply": "Here is what I found in your message: You seem to have positive feelings about this. You mentioned: goat"
}
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Session Synchronization**: Implement a more robust mechanism to ensure Flask session and workflow engine session data are always in sync.

2. **Variable Resolution Debugging**: Add more detailed logging for variable resolution to make troubleshooting easier.

3. **Error Recovery**: Enhance error handling to recover gracefully from variable resolution failures.

4. **Testing Framework**: Develop a comprehensive testing framework for workflow variable handling.
