# Graphie

# Abstract
Graphie is a graph-based agentic workflow modeling framework, developed by Mitchie, for general conversational and operational process handling. The ambition of this proposal is to initiate Graphie as foundational architecture that will be pivotal to maintain cohesion while scaling the DAO's ambitions. The primary goal of Graphie is a reduction in operational overhead.

# Problem
MoonDAO is successfully lauching initiatives that are quickly growing the network and developing the potential for profit, however a limiting factor remains; Operational overhead. 

All core operations (onboarding, contributing, submitting proposals, buying/staking MOONEY, voting, etc...) benefit from hand-holding, executive decisioning, or manual intervention. The expected extent of these cases will only increase alongside planned developments within the Space Acceleration Network, like Launchpad and Deprize. Our limited human capacity restricts scalability and could lead to missed opportunities, and simply adding more people often transposes the root problem to new types of operational overhead. 

# Solution  
The potentiality of Graphie for MoonDAO's purposes is massive, and so the proposed implementation will be to first focus on a simple, yet impactful, domain; Documentation and onboarding.

Our documentation can be dense, lengthy, or difficult to navigate. While it can answer nearly any question about MoonDAO, sourcing that answer is often time-consuming. 

By hosting a Discord bot, intelligently equipped by Graphie, to serve MoonDAO's documentation, we can guide users, based on the content of their queries, towards the most contextually relevant next step in their journey with MoonDAO. The agent can also be equipped to collect feedback from its users regarding their experience and launch an iterative development process wherein we expand the functionality based on the feedback.

Potential features include:
- Canvas view
- Onchain permissions handling
- 

# Benefits
- Better analytics 


# Risks

# Risks

1. **Technical Complexity**: Graph-based workflow systems require specialized knowledge to maintain. This risk is mitigated by providing thorough documentation and ensuring knowledge transfer to key DAO members.

2. **Adoption Barriers**: Users may resist using a new system if it's not intuitive. We'll address this by focusing on user experience, providing tutorials, and gathering continuous feedback during the initial rollout.

3. **Integration Challenges**: Connecting Graphie with existing MoonDAO systems could present unforeseen technical hurdles. We'll conduct thorough testing in staging environments before production deployment.

4. **Resource Allocation**: Hosting and maintaining the infrastructure requires ongoing resources. We've budgeted conservatively to ensure sustainability and will monitor usage to optimize costs.

5. **AI Limitations**: The conversational components may not always provide perfect answers. We'll implement clear fallback mechanisms and human escalation paths for complex queries.

6. **Data Privacy**: Handling user interactions requires careful attention to privacy. We'll implement proper data handling protocols and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

7. **Scope Creep**: The potential applications of Graphie are vast, risking project sprawl. We'll maintain strict focus on the initial documentation and onboarding use case before expanding functionality.

# Objectives

*You can write as many OKRs as you think are needed. One focused goal is preferred instead of many. OKRs should use SMART principles (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound).*

**Objective \#1:** *Host the infrastructure*  
**Key Results for Objective \#1**: 

- *What is a measurable result that indicates this objective has been met?*  
- *Include 3-4 relevant metrics that indicate success for the objective*

**Member(s) responsible for OKR** **and their role:**

# Team (Table A)

***Project Lead:** The Project Lead and representative for the project within the MoonDAO Senate. The Project Lead is responsible for:*

1. *Attending weekly town hall meetings, reviewing incoming proposals and voting on them within the Senate. Missed attendance will result in a 5% penalty to the rocketeer's retroactive rewards.*  
2. *Creating weekly updates to the community on the progress of the project in the "progress" channel on DIscord.*  
3. *Adding team members, removing team members, and making decisions about the use of the budget throughout the lifetime of the project.*  
4. *Creating and managing the Multisig Treasury for the project as well as the payments for each of the members.*  
5. *Creating the Final Report and returning unused funds to the MoonDAO Treasury.*

***Initial Team:** Projects may not need an initial team. It can just be an individual submitting a proposal. You may also create generic roles and hire other teammates after the project is approved. As a general rule of thumb, try to keep teams small and focused in the beginning, **with clear roles, deliverables, and OKRs for each member**. Team members are responsible for:*

1. *Posting a weekly update in the "progress" channel on Discord with their contributions that week. Not posting a weekly update will result in a 5% penalty to their retroactive rewards.*

| Project Lead | *@DiscordUsername* |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Initial Team** | *Role 1: "Developer" @DiscordUsername1. "Description of the role and deliverable for this member" Role 2: "Designer" @DiscordUsername2. "Description of the role and deliverable for this member"* |
| **Multisig signers\*** | *Five required with their ETH addresses listed. "@DiscordUsername1: eth:0x0...1" "@DiscordUsername2: eth:0x0...2" "@DiscordUsername3: eth:0x0...3" "@DiscordUsername4: eth:0x0...4" "@DiscordUsername5: eth:0x0...5" You can create a multisig [here](https://app.safe.global/welcome)* |
| **Multisig Address\*** | *ETH address with the Multisig* |

# Timeline (Table B)

| Days after Proposal Passes | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0 | Proposal Passes |
| 7 | *Insert your milestones here.* |
|  |  |

**Deadline for the project: End of Q3.**

# Budget (Table C)

*These are fixed costs to make your project happen. This might also include bounties that you'll make inside of the DAO (it's recommended to have some amount allocated for bounties or competitions), or specific work that must be contracted out to complete the project. Please provide links to quotes where possible.*

| Description  | Amount | Justification |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Description of the cost* | *e.g. $100* | *Why do you need this?* |

| **Total** | **0 ETH** |  |

# Transactions (Table D)

Please write out the specific transactions that need to be executed if this proposal passes. Please include the exact amount and token type and the receiving address (this is the multisig if there is more than one transaction that needs to be executed throughout the lifetime of this project.)

| Transaction Type | Amount | Token Type | Receiving Address |

| *Send* | *0* | *ETH* | *TBD* |
