# Project Reorganization Summary

This document summarizes the reorganization of the Graphie project structure to improve maintainability and clarity.

## Changes Made

### Directory Structure

We've organized the project into a clearer directory structure:

1. **Core Application Files** - Kept in the root directory:
   - `app.py` - Main Flask application
   - `engine.py` - Synced workflow engine
   - `fixed_engine.py` - Foundation engine
   - `setup.sh` - Main setup script
   - `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

2. **Created/Organized Directories**:
   - `tools/` - Workflow management scripts
   - `docs/` - Documentation files
   - `examples/` - Example workflow definitions and backups
   - `tests/` - Testing and debugging scripts

3. **Removed Directories**:
   - `debug/` - Contents moved to `tests/`
   - `backup/` - Contents moved to `examples/backup/`
   - `graphie/` - Empty directory removed

### File Relocations

1. **Workflow Management Scripts** moved to `tools/`:
   - `check_and_clean_workflow.py`
   - `check_workflow_steps.py`
   - `fix_show_analysis_node.py`
   - `update_workflow_for_fixed_engine.py`
   - `update_parallel_workflow.py`
   - `update_workflow.py`

2. **Documentation Files** moved to `docs/`:
   - `cleanup_codebase.md`
   - `MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md`
   - `devnotes.md`

3. **Example Files** moved to `examples/`:
   - `example_workflow.cypher`
   - `structured_generation_example.cypher`

4. **Testing/Debugging Scripts** moved to `tests/`:
   - `test_app_running.py`
   - `debug_openai_structured.py` (from `debug/`)

5. **Backup Files** moved to `examples/backup/`:
   - `neo4j_update.cypher`

### Path Updates

1. Updated `setup.sh` to reference the new paths for workflow tools
2. Updated `README.md` to reflect the new project structure
3. Created a verification script `tests/verify_project_structure.py` to ensure everything works correctly

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Improved Maintainability** - Related files are grouped together
2. **Clearer Structure** - Easier to understand the project organization
3. **Better Separation of Concerns** - Core application files are distinct from tools and tests
4. **Reduced Clutter** - Root directory contains only essential files
5. **Easier Onboarding** - New developers can quickly understand the project structure

## Verification

The reorganization has been verified using the `tests/verify_project_structure.py` script, which checks:
1. The existence of all required directories and files
2. The ability to start the application
3. The application's responsiveness on port 5001

All verifications have passed, confirming that the reorganization was successful and the application continues to function correctly.
